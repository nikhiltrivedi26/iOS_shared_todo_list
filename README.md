# iOS_shared_todo_list

This is a shared to do list built using Swift 4 and google firebase. To use it, just go to create an account, and then write 
an email (doesn't have to be a real email) but must have some characters, then @, some characters, then a ., then some
characters again. The password should be six characters or above. You'll see items from other users who have used the app.
Double tap to delete an item. Single tap to show it's a checkmark (done). You can also add items.
